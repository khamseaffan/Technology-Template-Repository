# Python-Project-Template

## Description
This repository serves as a template for designing and developing projects in Python. It is ready to use and includes features for build management, unit testing, continuous integration, static analysis, code style adherence, and component specification.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- pytest
- ruff
- mypy
- coverage
- uv

## Project Setup
To set up the project environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repo-name>
   ```
3. Install UV, the package manager for dependency management:
   For macOS/linux
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```
   Alternatively, for brew installation: [brew install uv](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/uv) is sufficient.

   For Windows
   ```bash
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

4. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
## Testing
To run all of the test suite at once:  
'''pytest
'''
To run individual tests:  
'''pytest <path-to-specific-test-file>
'''
