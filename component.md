A component is defined as an identifiable part of a larger program of solution. Usually, a component provides a specific functionality or group of related functions. Examples of a component could be a button on in a user interface or an interface to a database.
Components will normally share a similar set of qualities:
1. Components are encapsulated and take input and return output through a clearly defined interface.
2. Components are modular.
3. Components are independent are rarely have dependencies.
4. Components are reusable in different parts of a software project.
5. Components are interoperable and are able to be used across different systems and platforms.
